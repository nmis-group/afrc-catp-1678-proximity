MK2 BLE Based Proximity Sensor

Context
- NMIS has developed a proximity sensors based on RSSI of Bluetooth Low Energy operating device-to-device. There is not central basestation, each device is programmed to only parse device queries from other proximity sensors and ignore other devices.
- The device consistes of an Arduino Nano 33 BLE (based on Nordic nRF52840) and other modules to allow battery operation.
- The cost per device is consequently high due to the use of modules combined onto a PCB.
- The intention is to create a MK2 version that will take the capabilities and create a single IC with minimal additional module requirements.

Capabilities
The device essentially needs to have similar capabilites as an Arduino Nano 33 BLE (based on Nordic nRF52840):
- Bluetooth 5, IEEE 802.15.4-2006, 2.4 GHz transceive
- ARM Cortex M4 32-bit processor with FPU, 64 MHz
- Programmable via an appropriate C++ compiler
- Storage device for writing timestamps and device ID's
- Real-time clock (RTC) to allow accurate evaluation of time

Expectation
- A company to develop the prototype into a lower cost, single IC sensor hardware soltuon that will allow new software to be flashed to the device using the Arduino IDE (Arduino -> C/C++ -> board)

Likely MK2 High Level BoM
- Micrcontroller (likely Nordic nRF52840)
- RTC (similar to Adafruit DS3231 Precision RTC Breakout)
- SD Storage (similar to Microduino SD Storage)
- Battery/Charging (LiPo 3.7V and Powerboost 1000C charger)
- 5x LED with each able to be independently controlled by MC

Other Considerations
- Ability to reprogram via either by micro USB connection or suitable RX/TX connections to microcontroller.
